<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm on an exciting journey as I embark on a 6-month internship at Hugo Boss, where I'm contributing my innovative ideas to their cutting-edge projects.
 Simultaneously, I'm pursuing my Master's degree in Web Engineering, a field that truly ignites my passion.</p>

<p>I'm a creative and innovative thinker at heart, always on the lookout for fresh ways to approach problems and find solutions. 
Planning and organizing are like second nature to me, and I thrive in environments where I can put these skills to good use. 
I'm a firm believer in continuous learning, which is why I'm an avid consumer of podcasts, with favorites like Bloomberg and AndrewHuberman Lab that expand my horizons and keep me informed about the latest trends.
</p>

<p>When I'm not immersed in the world of technology and innovation, you can find me on the dance floor, expressing myself through dance. 
It's my way of staying connected to my creative side and taking a break from the digital world.</p>

<p>In addition to my professional pursuits, I'm a language enthusiast. 
I'm fluent in English and can hold intermediate-level conversations in Spanish, Italian, and German. Plus, I'm proud to say that I'm a native Albanian speaker.</p>
